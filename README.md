To run this on local server you need `python` to be installed on your device.

Create a virtual environment (optional)

    windows = `python -m venv venv`
    unix = `python3 -m venv venv`

Kill the current terminal and the new environment will be activated from the next terminal session.


Install `Flask` and `Flask-Cors`

After cloning the project install the client dependencies by running `npm i` and then you can start the client by `cd client/` and then `npm start`

To start the server `cd server/` and then `python app.py`
